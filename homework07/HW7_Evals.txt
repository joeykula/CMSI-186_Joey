Evaluation
==========
Nice work here, Joey!

Your solver runs fine!  Very good job.

I don't see a write-up of your reflections about the comparison of the actual
vs. the estimated method, which was a requirement.  That "research report" is
missing from your repo.

Your javadoc had one warning.  Remember in class I mentioned that you should
make sure it was "clean" meaning no errors and no warnings....  sorry.

Otherwise, well done, and a good ending to the semester!
