BALL CLASS TESTER PROGRAM
--------------------------

  Creating a new ball: 
    New ball created: A Ball at (0.0,0.0) with a speed of 1.414
     Testing toString() method 
     Info about the ball should be displayed
     Testing getCurrentX_Position() and getCurrentY_Position() methods
     Location should be (0,0) 
     Testing getCurrentSpeed() method 
     Result should have said 0
     The ball is still moving
     Testing isStillMoving() method 
     Result should have said  The ball is still moving
     The ball is in bounds
     Testing isInBounds() method 
     Result should have said the ball is in bounds 

 Testing move() method. Ball should be moved once with DEFAULT_TIMELICE
A Ball at (1.0,1.0) with a speed of 1.4
     Testing toString() method 
     Info about the ball should be displayed
     Testing getCurrentX_Position() and getCurrentY_Position() methods
     Location should be (1.0,1.0) 
     Testing getCurrentSpeed() method 
     Result should have said 1.4

     Testing isStillMoving() method 
     Result should have said  The ball is still moving
     The ball is in bounds
     Testing isInBounds() method 
     Result should have said the ball is in bounds

A Ball at (1.99,1.99) with a speed of 1.386
     Testing toString() method 
     Info about the ball should be displayed

     Result should have said  The ball is still moving
     The ball is in bounds
     Testing isInBounds() method 
     Result should have said the ball is in bounds 

 Testing move() method to see if it works after lots of iterations; move() method is caleed 80 more times with the same time slice
A Ball at (86.602,86.602) with a speed of 0.189
     Testing toString() method 
     Info about the ball should be displayed
     Testing getCurrentX_Position() and getCurrentY_Position() methods
     Location should be (86.602,86.602) 
     Testing getCurrentSpeed() method 
     Result should have said .189
     The ball is still moving
     Testing isStillMoving() method 
     Result should have said  The ball is still moving
     The ball is NOT in bounds
     Testing isInBounds() and setOfBounds() methods 
     Result should have said the ball is NOT in bounds as the x_position is now out of bounds
     
Moving ball once again to check setOutOfBounds() method 
     The setOutOfBounds() method should have revert the speed to 0 so the postion should not have changed
A Ball at (86.602,86.602) with a speed of 0.0
     Testing toString() method 
     Info about the ball should be displayed
     Testing getCurrentX_Position() and getCurrentY_Position() methods
     Location should be (86.602,86.602) 
     Testing getCurrentSpeed() method 
     Result should have said .189
     The ball is NOT moving
     Testing isStillMoving() method 
     Result should have said  The ball is NOT moving as the ball is no longer moving
     The ball is NOT in bounds
     Testing isInBounds() and setOfBounds() methods 
     Result should have said the ball is NOT in bounds as the x_position is now out of bounds

 Welcome to SoccerSim! 

This program simulates an arbitrary number of soccer balls being kicked on a perfectly flat playground with a height of 350 and a wideth of 150, at speeds and directions dictated by the user!

Do you want a flag pole in the field? 
Y - yes 
N - no

Pole created at (-36,-143) proceding with simulation...

At time t = 0.0 secounds:

At time t = 1.0 secounds:
A Ball at (1010.0,1010.0) with a speed of 0.0
