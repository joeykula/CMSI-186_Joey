Evaluation for homework 00: Greeter
   and Java Environment set up
   and GitHub repository set up/initialization
============================================

There must be a GitHub repository to which you have invited your humble
professor to collaborate.  The structure of the repository must be as is
specified in the assignment, including the name of the repo.  There must
be a "Greeter.java" source code file in the repository.  You do not need
to include the "Greeter.class" file unless you want to do so.  It will
be assumed that you have a working editor of some kind to create your
code and that it is configured correctly [no "funny" characters].  It will
also be assumed that you have a working Java installation so that your
compiler and JVM can execute your code.

============================================================================
Evaluation:
============================================================================
Maximum points: 8 out of 8 = 100% which is an A-plus

Java works        1.00 out of 1.00
Repo created      2.00 out of 2.00
Editor works      1.00 out of 1.00
Greeter runs      2.00 out of 2.00
Greeter in Repo   2.00 out of 2.00

Your score:
Total 8 out of 8 = 100% which is an A-plus


Explicit comments on the exercise:
----------------------------------
Your code did not compile!  The problem is you are missing a curly brace and
instead have a semicolon.  I fixed your code for you this time, and commented
the offending line so you can see the difference.  Here it is again:

IS:

   public static void main( String [] args ) ;


SHOULD BE:

   public static void main( String [] args ) {

Remember, code that doesn't compile will get no credit!

Also, try to be consistent about your indenting.  Make sure the closing
curly brace aligns with the first character of the line that starts the
definition for that block.  Further, make sure that everything inside that
block is indented to the same level.  Example:

   public void starting_line() {
      // line one
      // line two
      // all lines indented to the same level

   }   <==  PUT CLOSING CURLY BRACE HERE

   public void starting_line() {
      // line one
      // line two
      // all lines indented to the same level

}      <==  DON'T PUT CLOSING CURLY BRACE HERE

Finally, the name INSIDE the class file should NOT have the ".java" extent
applied.  It's "public class Greeter" not "public class Greeter.java".  That
is another reason your code didn't compile.  Make sure you try it from the
command line before you commit for submission.  I fixed everything and gave
you credit anyhow THIS time.....  :D

Otherwise, Nice work!
